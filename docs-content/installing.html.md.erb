## <a id="configure-tile"></a> Configure the Dynatrace Service Broker Tile

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Dynatrace Service Broker tile supports both the Dynatrace SaaS/Managed Service and the Dynatrace AppMon Service. Each product contains a relevant configuration setting. Multiple Dynatrace SaaS/Managed and multiple Dynatrace AppMon environments can be simultaneously supported.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Because service brokers cannot be deployed with empty service definitions, a service must be defined for both Dynatrace and Appmon. This can be a dummy entry with placeholder data.</p>

Perform the following steps to configure the Dynatrace Service Broker tile:

1. In Pivotal Ops Manager, click the **Dynatrace Service Broker** tile to open its configuration options.
